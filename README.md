## Create Booking API Test Automation with Robot framework

This Project does API test automation using Python and Robot Framework.

In this context, Python is used to define functions that are subsequently called in Robot framework.
Robot Framework can them be used to specify the tests to run.

## About Robot Framework

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework that supports acceptance testing, regression testing, and robotic process automation (RPA). It has a modular architecture, allowing users to extend its capabilities by creating custom libraries and plugins. The key features of Robot Framework include:

- **Keyword-Driven:** Tests are written using keywords that define actions and verifications.
- **Data-Driven:** Tests can be parameterized using data tables, making it easy to perform multiple test variations.
- **Built-in Libraries:** Robot Framework comes with a set of standard libraries that provide pre-built keywords for common tasks like interacting with web browsers, databases, and APIs.
- **Extensibility:** Users can create custom libraries in Python or Java, or import existing ones to enhance the framework's functionality.
